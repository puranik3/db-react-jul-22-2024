# React

-   A JS library
-   Created at Facebook
-   Virtual DOM - React elements will be used to define the UI declaratively
-   React is good at doing DOM manipulations efficiently
-   Reduces the code we need to write
-   Components - A small customizable, reusable piece of the UI
    -   convenient "pseudo HTML elements"
- We work with data, update data, and UI updates are taken care by React
